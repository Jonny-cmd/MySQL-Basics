# MySQL-Basics
Basic commands used within MySQL

Create-Databases is the data I used

SQL Project contains the commands I used within SQL.

Within the word file you can find a screenshot of the commands I used within SQL, along with my relation tree for the data I was using.



Above each segment of code, there is a description starting with a '#' to seperate my notes on what each bit of code does, and the commands themselves.
